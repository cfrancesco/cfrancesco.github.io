    Implementation of a non-autoregressive text-to-speech Transformers network.
    Samples, fully trained models and documentation are available on the project page.
    Based on a server-less AWS architecture, this model (German, not open-sourced) is used in an experimentalfeature on the welt.de website for synthesis of audio articles.

    Image upscaling and quality enhancing system using GANs.
    In this project SOTA solutions were combined, modified and implemented and several pre-trained networks for different use-cases are provided.
    The documentation can be found [here](https://idealo.github.io/image-super-resolution/)
    I wrote about this project in a blog post series: [part 1](https://medium.com/idealo-tech-blog/a-deep-learning-based-magnifying-glass-dae1f565c359), [part 2](https://medium.com/idealo-tech-blog/zoom-in-enhance-a-deep-learning-based-magnifying-glass-part-2-c021f98ebede)
