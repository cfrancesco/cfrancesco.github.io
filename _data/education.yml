    Applied mathematics for scientific computations, engineering and applications.

    Main focus on Optimization Algorithms, Statistics and Numerics for PDEs, later specialized in Machine Learning and Bayesian Inference.

    In my thesis I defined a novel Bayesian Optimization approach to jointly optimize closely related black-box functions using Gaussian Processes.
    
    During my research assistant experience I also created a parallel version of the (collapsed) Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm for natural language topic modelling..
