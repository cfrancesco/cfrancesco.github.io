    At idealo I was part of the early small Machine Learning team which mostly tackled computer vision topics such as Image Estetics, Image Deduplication and Image Super-Resolution.
    Super Resolution was my main project during this time.

    I also dealt with data pipelines and deployment and I had the chance to present our results to the ML community at conferences and meetups.

    The technologies I used here include Python (keras, tensorflow, pandas, sklearn, ..), Docker, AWS (EC2, S3) and Openshift.
